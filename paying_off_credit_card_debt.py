""" Problem set 1: Introduction to Computer Science and Programming(MIT Courseware) """ 

""" Suppose, each month, a credit card statement will come with the option for us to pay a minimum
 amount of our charge, usually 2% of the balance due. However, the credit card company earns 
 money by charging interest on the balance that we don’t pay. So even if we pay credit card 
 payments on time, interest is still accruing on the outstanding balance. We will demonstrate it in following
 programs. 

 Say we’ve made a $5,000 purchase on a credit card with 18% annual interest rate and 2% minimum monthly payment rate. 
 If we want to know the remaining balance after a year, we can use the following equations. 
 Minimum monthly payment = Minimum monthly payment rate x Balance 
 (Minimum monthly payment gets split into interest paid and principal paid) 
 Interest Paid = Annual interest rate / 12 months x Balance 
 Principal paid = Minimum monthly payment – Interest paid 
 Remaining balance = Balance – Principal paid 

 This is a program to calculate the credit card balance after one year if a person only pays the minimum monthly payment required by
 the credit card company each month. 
 User input: the outstanding balance on the credit card, annual interest rate, minimum monthly payment rate.
 For each month, this will print the minimum monthly payment, remaining balance, principle paid in 
 the format shown in the test cases below. All numbers should be rounded to the nearest penny. Finally, this 
 will print the result, which shall include the total amount paid that year and the remaining balance.

 minimum monthly payment rate to 4%. As illustrated in the second test case below, people 
 will be able to pay less interest over the years and get out of debt faster

""" Now write a program that calculates the minimum fixed monthly payment needed in order to pay
off a credit card balance within 12 months. We will not be dealing with a minimum monthly
payment rate.
Take as raw_input() the following floating point numbers:
1. the outstanding balance on the credit card
2. annual interest rate as a decimal 
Print out the fixed minimum monthly payment, number of months (at most 12 and possibly less
than 12) it takes to pay off the debt, and the balance (likely to be a negative number).
Assume that the interest is compounded monthly according to the balance at the start of the
month (before the payment for that month is made). The monthly payment must be a multiple of
$10 and is the same for all months. Notice that it is possible for the balance to become negative
using this payment scheme. In short:
Monthly interest rate = Annual interest rate / 12.0
Updated balance each month = Previous balance * (1 + Monthly interest rate) – Minimum
